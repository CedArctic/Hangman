# hangman
This is a simple utilization of the classic hangman game written in C language. The code is well documented with comments so feel free to take a look for yourself.

This version is a clone of [this project](https://github.com/CedArctic/hangman). This version makes the guess process non-case-sensitive, removes the need for the conio.h library, which is non-standard and outdated, tells the user what letters they have guessed wrong and is more stable because putting in more than 20 characters won't crash the program anymore. (The limit has not been removed, I think the original author wanted it to be simple and fast. The program won't crash, but it won't let you play properly either.)


# Instructions
Just download one of the releases or download the source (hangman.c) and compile it yourself.

>Linux/Mac OS users: Run ./hangman in the terminal.

>Windows users: Run the hangman.exe.
